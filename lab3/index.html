		<h1>Lab 3 File Structures</h1>
			<p>The idea of this lab was to get familiar with file structures by creating local file structures on Atom and creating index.html files.</p>
				<h2>Challenges</h2>
					<p>Everything was pretty smooth and I didn't have much or any trouble. One thing that took some time in figuring out was when I had to resize my photo because it looked too big. Something that proved to be challenging though was trying to help others with their Lab. I had some success in helping Sonia but I coudln't fully help Monique with some of her lab problems.</p>
						<h2>Results</h2>
							<p>You are currently looking at the index.html file I created.</p>
